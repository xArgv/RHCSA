11. Working with Systemd
		
	11.1 Understanding Systemd
		
		Systemd is the manager of everything
		It's the first thing that starts after the kernel
		It starts porcesses and manages mounts, timers, paths and much more
		It is event driven, whch means that it can react to specific events
		The items that are managed by systemd are called units
		Default units are in /usr/lib/systemd/system, custom units are in /etc/systemd
		systemctl is the management interface to work with Systemd
	
	11.2 Managing Systemd Services
		
		systemctl -t help - shows unit types
		systemctl list-unit-files - lists all installed units and their status
		systemctl list-units - lists active units
		systemctl start [name of service] - starts a service
		systemctl enable [name of service] - enables a service to be started on boot
		systemctl disable [name of service] - disables a service from starting on boot
		systemctl stop [name of service] - stops a service
		systemctl status [name of service] - gives information about a service
	
	11.3 Modifying Systemd Service Configuration
		
		Default system-provided unit files are in /usr/lib/systemd/system - don't touch them
		Custom unit files are in /etc/systemd/system
		Run-time automatically generated unit files are in /run/systemd
		
		systemctl cat [name of service] - shows the configuration of the unit
		systemctl show [name of service] - shows all available configurations for this unit
		systemctl edit [name of sercice] - allows you to edit service configuration
		systemctl deaemon-reload - use after modifying service configuration to reload the unit configuration
		systemctl restart [name of service] - use after modifying service configuration
