17. Managing the Boot Procedure
	
	17.3 Modifying Grub2 Persistent Parameters
		
		To edit persistent Grub2 parameters, edit the configuration file in /etc/default/grub
		After writing changes compile changes to grub.cfg
			
			bios - grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
			efi - grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
		
	17.4 Managing Systemd Targets
		
		A systemd target is a group of unit files
		Some targets are isolatable, which means that they difine the final state a system is starting in:
			
			emergency.target - this is the minimal target that allows troubleshooting
			rescue.target - also a troubleshooting target but with more services
			multi-user.target - this is the non graphical target
			graphical.target - this is the graphical target
	
	17.5 Setting the Default Systemd Target
		
		systemctl get-default - show the default systemd target
		systemctl set-default - sets the default systemd target
		
	17.6 Booting into a Specific Target
		
		On the grub2 boot prompt, use systemctl.unit=xxx.target to boot into a specific target
		systemctl isolate xxx.target - change between targets on a running system
