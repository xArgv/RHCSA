08. Configuring Networking
	
	8.1 Understanding IPv4 Networking
		
		In IPv4, each node needs its own IP address, writen in dotted decimal notation (192.168.4.200/24)
		Each IP address must be indicated with the subnet mask behind it
		The default router or gateway specifies which server to forward packets to that have an external destination
		The DNS nameserver is the IP address of a server that helps resolving names to IP adresses and the other way around
	
	8.2 Understanding NIC Naming
		
		IP address configuration needs to be connected to a specific network device
		Use ip link show to see current devices, and ip addr show to check their configuration
		Every system has an lo device, which is for internal networking
		Apart from that, you'll see the name of the real network device, which is presented as a BIOS name
		
		Classical naming is using device names like eth0, eth1 and so on
			
			These device names don't reveal any information about physical device location
		
		BIOS naming is based on hardware properties to give more specific information in the device name
			
			em[1-N] for embedded NICs
			eno[nn] for embedded NICs
			p<slot>p<port> for NICs on the PCI bus
		
		If the driver doesn't reveal netwowrk device properties, classical naming is used
	
	8.3 Managing Runtime Configuration with ip
		
		The ip tool can be used to manage all aspects of IP networking
		It replaces the legacy ifconfig tool, do NOT use ifconfig anymore
		Use ip addr to manage address properties
		Use ip link to show link properties
	
	8.5 Managing Persistent Networking with nmcli
		
		An nmcli connection is a configuration that is added to a network device
		Connections are stored in configuration files
		The NetworkManager service must be running to manage these files
	
	8.7 Verifying Network Configuration Files
	
		/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ - network configuration files 
		
	8.8 Testing Network Connections
		
		ping - is used to test connectivity
		ip addr show - shows current network configuration
		ip route show - shows current routing table
		dig - can test DNS servers
