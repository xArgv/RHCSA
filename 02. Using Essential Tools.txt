	2.1 Getting Started with Linux Commands
		
		pwd - prints working directory
		whoami - shows currently logged user

	2.3 Understanding I/O Redirection and Piping
		
		Redirection uses STDIN, STDERR and STDOUT to work with command input and output in a flexible way
		
		> - redirects the output to a file
		>> - appends the output to a file
		2> - redirects only the error messages
		< - redirects the standart input
		
		In piping, the STDOUT of the first command is used as STDIN for the second command
		
	2.6 Using man
		
		section 1 - commands run by normal users
		section 5 - configuration files
		section 8 - room commands
		
		Synopsis:
			
			bold text - type exactly as shown
			italic text - mandatory argument
			[] - optional argument
			... - repeatable
			a|b - a and b cannot be used together
