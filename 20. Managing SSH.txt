20. Managing SSH
	
	20.2 Setting up SSH-Key based login
		
		ssh-keygen - creates a public/private key pair for the current user
		ssh-copy-id - copies the public key	over to the target server
		ssh-agent /bin/bash - allocate space in the bash shell to cache the private key passphrase
		ssh-add - adds the current passphrase to the cache
	 
	20.3 Chaning common SSH Server options
		
		server options are set in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		client options can be set in /etc/ssh/ssh_config
		
		port 22 - set the sshd port, must configure SElinux to allow the new port
		PermitRootLogin - considered to be a security issue, keep it off
		PubkeyAuthentication - allow key authentication
		PasswordAuthentication - allow password authentication
		X11Forwarding - allow grarphical screen
		
	20.4 Securely copying files
		
		scp can be used to securely copy files over the network, usingg the sshd process
			
			scp file1 file2 student@remoteserver:/home/student
			scp -r root@remoteserver:/tmp/files .
		
		sftp offers an FTP client interface to securely transfer files using SSH
			
			put /my/file - to upload a file
			get /your/file - to download a file
			exit - close an sftp session
			
	20.5 Securely Synchronizing files
		
		rsync - using SSH to synchronize files
			
			if source and target already exist, rsync will only sync their differences
			
			-r - will recursively sync the entire directory tree
			-l - sync symbolic links
			-p - preserves symolic lins
			-n - will do a dry run before actually synchronizing
			-a - uses archive mode, which is equivalent to -rlptgoD
			-A - uses archive mode and also synchronizes ACLs
			-X - will synchronize SELinux contect as well
