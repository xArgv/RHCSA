			facility - the specific facility that the log is created for
			severity - the severity from which should be logged
			destination - the file or other destination the log should be written to
		
		Log files normaly are in /var/log

	13.3 Working with systemd-journald
		
		systemd-journald is the log service that is part of systemd
		systemctl status <unit> - to check unit specific journal
		Messages are logged also to rsyslogd, using rsyslogd imjournal module
