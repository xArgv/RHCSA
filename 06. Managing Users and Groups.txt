06. Managing Users and Groups

	When adding new users that are going to be part of a new group its better to create the groups first!
	
	6.3 Creating Users with useradd
		
		useradd - add new user
			
			-c - adds a comment for the user
			-e - experi date for the account
			-g - specify the primary group (not necessery on rhel/centos system)
			-G - specify a secondary group
			-s - specify the login shell
			
			wheel is the sudo user group
			
		usermod - modify user accounts
		userdel - deletes a user
		id - shows information about an user
		passwd - set user password
		
	6.4 Creating Groups with groupadd
		
		groupadd - add new group
		
	6.5 Managing User and Group Properties
		
		w - displays logged users
		who - displays a shorter version of w
		getent passwd [username] -  displays info about a user
		
		usermod - modifies user account properties
			
			-G - new list of secondary groups (removes the old groups)
			-a - append the new secondary groups to the old groups
				
				usermod -aG sales bob - this will add bob to the sales group without removing any other secondary groups
			
		userdel - deletes a user
		groupdel - deletes a group
	
	6.6 Configuring Defaults for New Users
		
		useradd -D - display or modify default useradd cofiguration stored in /etc/default/useradd
		/etc/login.defs - is the default configuration file
		/etc/skel - contains files that are copying to /home for new users
		
	6.7 Managing Password Properties
		
		passwd [option] <accountName> - manage user account password
			
			-l - locks the account
			-u - unlocks the account
			-e - expires a password (user must set new password when they login)
			
			--stdin - set new password from standart input
				
				for i in merry miya ariana nicki; do echo changeyourpassword | sudo passwd --stdin $i; done
				
		chage - change user password expiry info
		
	6.8 Understanding User and Group Configuration Files
		
		/etc/passwd - contains user account information
		/etc/shadow - contains user password info
		/etc/group - contains all groups
		/etc/gshadow - legacy file for group passwords, not used anymore
		
		vipw - edits /etc/passwd in a temp file
		vipw -s - edits /etc/shadow in a temp file
		vigr - edits /etc/groups in a temp file
			
			those commands are useful because someone else may be adding/removing users and groups which will modify the configuration files and will make a conflict
			
	6.9 Managing Current Sessions
		
		w - displays logged users
		who - displays a shorter version of w
		
		loginctl - allows for current session management
			
			list-sessions - displays all open sessions
			session-status <id> - shows session status
			kill-sessions <id> - kills session
