09. Managing Processes
	
	9.1 Understanding Processes
		
		init is the top process that have pid 1 in linux thats systemd, all other processes are children of systemd
			
		    systemd
				├─── sshd
					 ├─── bash
						  ├─── top
					  
		
		If the parent process is killed the children will die too
		Threed is a process within the process, which means that a process can have one pid but can run multiple taks at the same time, also called multy threded proccess
	
	9.2 Managing Shell Jobs
		
		command & - starts a command in the background
		Ctrl + Z - pause a job
		bg - resumes a job 
		jobs - shows all jobs in the background
		fg [job number] - brings a job to the foreground
	
	9.3 Getting Process Information with ps
		
		ps aux - shows running processes
		ps ef - shows pid of parent process
		ps fax - shows tree of child processes
		watch uptime - uptime will show the load average of the CPU, watch will repeat the command every 2 seconds
	
	9.6 Monitoring System Activity with top
		
		top - a dashboard that allows you to monitor current system activity
		
			f - show and select from available display fields
			M - filter the memory usage
			W - save new display settings
			k - allows you to send a signal to a process
			r - renice a process
			
	9.7 Sending Signals to Processes
		
		kill -[signal] [pid] - send kill signal to a process
		
			9 - kill the process
			15 - send a terminate signal
			
		killall [process name] - kill all process with a specific name
	
	9.8 Managing Priorities and Niceness
		
		Nice values range from -20 up to 19, the lower the value the more CPU usage
		
		renice -n [niceness level] [pid] - changes the niceness level of a process
		nice -n [niceness level] [commands] - starts a process with a specific niceness level
	
	9.9 Using Tuned Profiles
		
		tuned - service that allows for a performance optimization in an easy way
		tuned-adm list - show a list of profiles
		tuned-adm profile <name> - will set a prifle
		tunead-adm active - will show the current profile
