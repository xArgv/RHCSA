14. Managing Storage

	lsblk - list storage devices
	lsof - list open files
	findmnt - shows all fyle system
	
	14.4 Creating Partitions with parted
		
		While creating a partition, you don NOT automatically create a file system
		
		parted /dev/sdb - to create new partition in /dev/sdb
			
			print - will show if there is current partition table
			mklabel msdos|gpt - to create MBR or GPT partition
			
			mkpart part-type name fs-type start end
				
				part-type - applies to MBR only and sets primary, logical, or extended partition 
				name - arbitrary name, required for GPT
				fs-type - does NOT modify the filesystem, but sest some irrelevant file system dependent metadata
				start end - specify start and end, counting from the beginning of the disk
				
				example - mkpart primary 1024MiB 2048MiB
			
			Alternatively, use mkpart in interactive mode
			
			print - to verify that the partition was created
			quit - to exit the parted shell
			udevadm settle - to ensure that the new partition device is created
		
	14.7 Making and Mounting File Systems
		
		mkfs.<fileSystem> /dev/<device> -  to create a file system on a device
		
		/mnt is the directory used for temoprary mounts
		
		mount /dev/<device> /mnt - will mount the device on /mnt
		umount <mount location> - unmounts a device
	
	14.8 Mounting Partitions through /etc/fstab
		
		/etc/fstab - is the main configuration file to persistently mount partitions
		systemctl deamon-reload - after editing /etc/fstab to update systemd
	
	14.9 Managing Persistent Naming Attributes
		
		tune2fs -L <name> /dev/<device> - set a lable for a device name
		xfs_admin -L <name> /dev/<device> - set a lable for xfs file systems
		blkid - check block id and labels
	
	14.11 Managing XFS File Systems	
		
		xfsdump - create a backup of an xfs device
		xfsrestore - restore a backup of an xfs device
		xfsrepair - repair broken xfs file systems
	
	14.12 Creating a Swap Partition
		
		In parted set linix-swawp as the file system
		mkswap /dev/<device> - to create the swap file system
		swapon /dev/<device> - to activate the swap partition
